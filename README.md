A simple TCP honeypot done as a mini project as a team (J2S-->Janan,Jousha,Sharoz).

#HONEYPOT:

A honeypot is a decoy computer system for trapping hackers or tracking unconventional or new hacking methods.
Honeypots are designed to purposely engage and deceive hackers and identify malicious activities performed over the Internet.
Multiple honeypots can be set on a network to form a honeynet.

#TCP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. 
TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other

#This works as a linux daemon
